ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System using NLP
This repository contains the code for a Movie Recommendation System that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to suggest movies based on user preferences and inputs. The system is designed to analyze movie descriptions, plot summaries, and user reviews to find similarities between films, enabling personalized recommendations.

Features:
Content-Based Recommendations: Suggests movies based on textual similarities in descriptions, genres, and keywords.
NLP Techniques: Utilizes techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, and cosine similarity to process and analyze text data.
Data Sources: Includes IMDb movie dataset with metadata like genres, plot summaries, and reviews.
Efficient Search: Implements various NLP models to compare movie content and recommend the most relevant titles.
Interactive Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input their preferences and receive tailored recommendations.
Tech Stack:
Python: Backend processing and NLP models.
Pandas & NumPy: Data handling and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms for NLP.
NLTK/Spacy: Text preprocessing and natural language understanding.
Flask/Django: Web interface for user interaction (optional).
